For simple, hackable examples that will help you get started in a few minutes, see the directories above.

For more complex cases - e.g. calibrating a LIGGGHTS DEM simulation of a GranuDrum - see the collection of peer-reviewed Digital Twins we maintain [here](https://github.com/uob-positron-imaging-centre/DigitalTwins).
